            <h4>1. Who I Am</h4>
            <p>I'm a 21 year old in love with life. An avid programmer, reader, and learner. 
              I spend my time in ways so that I can grow as a man. My goal is to have the same feeling
             for what I create than for what I feel when listening to Pink Floyd´s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jMlFXouPk8" target="_blank"> High Hopes </a>, for what I feel when reading Ayn Rand´s
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fountainhead" target="_blank" > The Fountainhead </a>, for what I feel when I play <a href="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/96/b9/49/96b949b0705226789029b625782eadda.jpg" target="_blank">
            Xenoblade Chronicles</a>, and for what I feel when I see a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnoNITE-CLc" target="_blank"> rocketship´s takeoff</a>. 
            Im currently a Colombian citizen, University of los Andes student and the youngest of two siblings.</p>

                <p>This was my middle-carreer project. Alongside 3 other students, we developed an app for getting to know the country within.
                   As we know, Colombia is full of hidden nature and hidden stories, kept from us due to the country's cultural, political, social and geografical complexities.
                   We wanted to expose certain places and people that had lived through the armed conflict and were now developing projects based on tourism 
                    throughout the country. All of us were, and some still are, skeptical about these comunities. However, we wanted to transform this feeling and 
                    explore everything Colombia has to offer.

                <h6> Learn </h6>
                <p>
                  This is a personal project that's currently being developed. My aim is to reform learning. There is so much we are doing wrong right now
                  education-wise, not even the people who have access to this privilege are learning properly. Do you remember what you learned last week? What you learned in college?
                  How about what you learned in high school. I'm certain you remember less than 10% in terms of lecture content. So pretend you invested 10 years of learning, that means
                  you have already "lost" 9 years! Of course, content is not the only thing we learn through education but, wouldn't it be nice to remember at least 70% of what you learn years from now?
                  I'm mixing aspects of neuroscience, machine learning, and psychology to construct something so that I can spend less time learning each activity and have great recall later on.

                <h6> Zero Waste </h6>
                <p>
                  This was my first project in university. I gathered with some friends and developed an app so that we could stop throwing away so much food. It was not easy, though, we spent 
                  long nights trying to do stuff that takes a matter of minutes right now. But I guess that's part of learning, isn't it? We had this idea because so much resources were being wasted.
                  Just imagine the amount of food-related waste produced at each home each week, now multiply it by the population of Bogota. It's not sustainable!

            <h4>3. Non Academic Life</h4>
            <p>
              I enjoy new experiences, so I'm always looking for different yet challenging activities to learn. 
              From diferent kind of sports such as golf, squash, basketball, swimming and mountain biking, to activities such as reading, singing, playing guitar and bass. My favorite
              books right now are: Los Ejercitos by Evelio Rosero, The Fountainhead by Ayn Rand, Into Thin Air by Jon Krakauer and Notes from Underground by Fyodor Dostoyevski. I like playing 
              video games when I have the time. My favorite ones are: Final Fantasy VII, Mass Effect 2, Metal Gear Solid 3 and Xenoblade Chronicles. I love to lay down and listen to 60s, 70s and 80s
              music. My favorite bands/artists are: Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, The Doors and Bob Dylan.
